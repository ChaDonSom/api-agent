Began under the idea of having chatgpt make an agent. I can't remember what started it. Somehow I noticed how easy it could be to have an AI plan out a way to get data. Maybe by watching Sonnet 4 in Copilot? Sonnet 4 impressed with its checking the codebase before working. Oh yeah I remember thinking about a hand-off from Gemini to a PWA agent. Can't quite expose hooks to Gemini yet, but you could ask it to start the PWA agent. "Gemini, get me Crew Console Tom" or something. Sonnet 4's improvement of late made it more exciting to try. I experimented with Vue state sync offline-first / local-first machines before and Sonnet 4 and GPT 4.1 made me feel like it could be done. I had GPT 4.1 make an agent who just had a dummy API to work with. Then added the real API. I found out of late, that the agent needs to have more idea whether what it's doing is working, like a deeper 'confidence' criterion or something. It's still just an LLM that bumbles through stuff. But, impressive nonetheless. The codebase probably needs a lot of cleaning though if I want to keep it understandable for myself.
